# 📝 My Tasks App

My second application created on React and Vite. It is a simple and convenient web application for managing a list of tasks.

## 🚀 About the project

This project was created to practice working with React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), data immutability principles, and a component-based approach. The app allows you to effectively track your daily tasks with automatic sorting of completed tasks.

### Key features:
* **Dynamic sorting:** Completed tasks are automatically moved to the end of the list so they don't distract you.
* **Data storage:** Integration with `localStorage` allows you to save your task list even after closing the tab.
* **Interactive interface:** Smooth animations, visual counter for active tasks, and hotkey support (Enter).

**TECHNOLOGIES:** React, TypeScript, Vite, CSS3.
